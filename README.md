## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a junior developer currently learning JavaScript and using this space to document my progress through hands-on, beginner-friendly projects. This repository is a reflection of my journey into web development, where I focus on understanding the core concepts of JavaScript and building simple, functional applications that help reinforce what Iâ€™ve learned.

JavaScript is the foundation of most of my work right now. Iâ€™m exploring everything from variables, functions, and loops to DOM manipulation, events, and basic asynchronous programming. Each project I build is designed to practice specific skills while also resulting in something useful, fun, or educational.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find small projects like to-do lists, calculators, interactive forms, mini-games, and other web-based tools. These are created with beginner developers in mindâ€”featuring clean, readable code and plenty of comments to explain how things work. I aim to write code thatâ€™s easy to follow and can serve as a reference for others learning alongside me.

In addition to JavaScript, Iâ€™m also working with HTML and CSS to create simple user interfaces and layouts that help bring my projects to life. As I grow more confident, I plan to explore modern frameworks like React, as well as topics like APIs, local storage, and basic version control with Git.

This repository is all about learning through doing. I believe that building real thingsâ€”even small onesâ€”is the best way to improve as a developer. I welcome anyone whoâ€™s learning too, or who has advice or ideas to share.

Feel free to explore, try out the projects, or contribute. I'm excited to keep growing and to share that journey here in the open.
